Personal Sprint tracker for outlook callendar
You just need to share your callendar and get the shared url, put in the app and set the sprint start date, right now it is using two weeks for a sprint, I will add one 'end date' field later.
I made it for personal use, so some features fit only for my personal usage. ex: if you have conflicting events it will get the one with longer duration and merge in one event. 
And you can add custom events too, usefull to track meetings that you forget to add on callendar. 
Feel free to contribute and improve the app.
